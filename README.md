# OEIS

This repository holds code dedicated to computing series in the OEIS, found at oeis.org
Every file is named by its OEIS sequence number, and can be called with (filename).main(n). the outputs is the b file for that sequence, computed up to the first $n$ terms.
Most pieces of code have a long explanation at the beginning explaining the logic behind how it works
